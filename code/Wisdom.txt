Iron Maiden Wisdom
"Out in the madness, the all-seeing eye,
Flickers above us, to light up the sky"
"Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait.
Don't you stray, don't fade away.
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may.
Don't you stray, from the narrow way"
"I'm not a number, I'm a free man.
Live my life where I want to"
"Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast;
For it is a human number.
Its number is six hundred and sixty six."
"Into the night they fall through the sky
No one should fly where eagles dare."
"Sunlight, falling on your steel,
Death in life is your ideal,
Life is like a wheel rolling on and on"
"Run, live to fly, fly to live, do or die,
Run, live to fly, fly to live, Aces high"
"Questions are a burden,
And answers are a prison for oneself"
"Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years,
Face up; make your stand and realise you're living in the golden years"
"I've got to keep running the course,
I've got to keep running and win at all costs,
I've got to keep going, be strong,
Must be so determined and push myself on"
"The evil that men do lives on and on!"
